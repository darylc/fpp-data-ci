"""Verify that a Request Plugin Removal issue comes from the plugin's owner.

Runs when a `removal-request` issue is opened/edited. GitHub has already
AUTHENTICATED the issue author, so `ISSUE_AUTHOR` is their real login - the job
is only to decide whether that login owns the named plugin's repo.

Verdicts:
  verified   - issue author == the repo owner parsed from srcURL (personal repo),
               OR the repo is archived / gone (nothing to protect).
  unconfirmed- repo is org-owned or the author isn't the owner; GitHub won't tell
               our CI their write access, so ask for proof-of-control:
               set `"delist": true` in the plugin's pluginInfo.json (only someone
               with write access can), which also becomes the machine signal.
  not_found  - the named repoName isn't in pluginList.json at all. There's no
               listing to remove, so this is auto-closed rather than left for a
               maintainer (see the workflow's "Auto-close: not listed" step).
  error      - couldn't resolve the plugin / repo for some other reason. Two
               flavors: a transient one (couldn't fetch the listed
               pluginInfo.json right now - network blip, rate limit) that
               just needs a `/recheck` later and doesn't need a maintainer at
               all; and a structural one (can't determine owner/repo from the
               listing at all) that does.

Reads ISSUE_AUTHOR and ISSUE_BODY from the environment. Writes a Markdown comment
to --output and the verdict label to $GITHUB_OUTPUT (key `verdict`).

    `transient` marks the one failure mode that's worth telling the reporter to
    just `/recheck` later instead of waiting on a maintainer: the listed
    pluginInfo.json URL didn't fetch. That's a network/rate-limit blip as often
    as a real dead link, and either way the fix is the same non-human action -
    try again.

    Matches case-insensitively: GitHub repo names are case-insensitive in URLs,
    but a plugin's declared repoName (what pluginList.json stores) doesn't
    always match its repo's URL casing byte-for-byte (e.g. "fpp-PulseMesh" vs.
    the repo slug "fpp-pulsemesh") -- an exact match would wrongly report a
    listed plugin as not found.

    `not_found` is split out from the other error cases: it means the repoName
    genuinely isn't listed (nothing to remove), vs. a listed entry we merely
    failed to resolve (network/data problem) - callers auto-close the former
    and leave the latter for a maintainer.
