    """Distinct logins with demonstrated write access to owner/repo, found by
    walking first-parent history from HEAD (the same mainline `git log

    gh_get_contributors for an org repo that takes outside PRs: a one-off
    external contributor's commit inflates the contributor count exactly as
    much as a real maintainer's.

    Every commit on the first-parent chain required write access to get
    there, however it got there: a merge commit only exists because someone
    with merge rights created it (and its `author` field IS that person, not
    the PR's submitter), while a plain commit reachable via first-parent was
    pushed directly to the branch - only possible with write access. A merged
    PR's OWN commits are correctly excluded either way: they're only reachable
    via the merge commit's second parent, never its first, so the walk never
    touches them.

    This starts from (and subsumes) an earlier version of this function that
    only credited merge-commit authors - that missed FalconChristmas' most
    tenured contributors entirely (cpinkham on fpp-BigButtons,
    computergeek1507 on fpp-brightness: both write directly to the branch,
    never merging anyone else's PR in these repos, so a mergers-only view saw
    them as strangers). The first-parent walk catches both cases in one pass,
    with no separate self-merge check needed - direct-push or merge, everyone
    it finds already proved write access by definition.

    One API call fetches up to `scan_limit` recent commits (each with its full
    parent SHA list); the first-parent chain is then walked locally with no
    further requests, starting at the batch's first entry (HEAD, since the
    list endpoint returns newest-first) and repeatedly following
    commit.parents[0].sha within the fetched batch. The walk stops early if a
    parent isn't in the fetched batch (older than `scan_limit` commits back) -
    fine for finding currently-active maintainers, not meant to cover a repo's
    entire history. `limit` bounds the returned list. Public endpoint, no
    special access needed. Best-effort - returns [] on any failure, never
    raises.
