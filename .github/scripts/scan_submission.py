"""Compliance scan for a brand-new plugin submission issue.

Reuses the same checks as the retroactive fpp<major> campaign (lint_plugin.py, the
pluginInfo.json schema check, and the repo-metadata checks — all shared via
lib_plugin_schema.py so the two scanners can't quietly drift apart), but gates HARDER:
a plugin that's already listed keeps working if it picks up a BEST_PRACTICE finding
after the fact — campaign findings are advisory, they never block a listing or trigger
its removal on their own. A plugin asking to be listed for the FIRST time has no such
grandfathering: here, BEST_PRACTICE findings block same as BLOCKER, not just advisory.
OPTIONAL stays advisory in both cases (LICENSE/README/icon/bugURL are nice-to-have,
not a gate).

repoName and the github.com repo are never taken from the submitter — both are derived
here from pluginInfo.json itself (repoName is a field in the JSON; the repo comes from
its srcURL, falling back to the raw.githubusercontent.com pluginInfo-url). There is
nothing left for a submitter-supplied copy to mismatch against, so unlike the campaign
scanner there is no repo-name-mismatch check here.

Usage:
  scan_submission.py --plugininfo-url <raw pluginInfo.json URL> \
      --schema .github/schema/pluginInfo.schema.json --out result.json
